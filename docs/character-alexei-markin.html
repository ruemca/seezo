                <h1><span class="bookletter">a</span>lexei Markin</h1>
                <p>Straight dark hair covering blue eyes, skinny physique, white embroidered traditional Russian shirt</p>
                <p>Born in a small village in western Russia to a severely depressed woman with four children (Alexei
                    the oldest, twins Lyuba and Nikolai, and Ania the youngest). When Nikolai died their mother went
                    crazy with grief. Nearly 2 years later their house burned down (most likely set on fire by mother),
                    killing both parents as well as Lyuba. Alexei escaped with Ania and went west, eventually ending up
                    in Lithuania and begging fare on a cargo ship to Denmark. </p>
                <p>His voice is starting to get lower and crack more often, but he still sounds like a kid. </p>
                <p>He inherited clinical depression from his mother, which became very apparent after his family died
                    and he left Russia. He has some guilt and trauma related to the fire- he was the oldest kid and
                    most responsible, so he should have saved them, or shouldn't have run away. </p>
                <p>Their parents loved each other, but their mother went crazy sometimes, causing their father to
                    immerse himself in his work or focus his efforts on taking care of her, ignoring his children
                    inadvertently. Alexei was in charge most of the time and felt very pressured. He's had some trouble
                    adjusting to life on Seezo since he was older when he arrived, and he's no longer the sole
                    responsible person around for Ania. The other boys try to get him to do things like swimming and
                    hiking, but he's shy and nervous. Aidan especially has taken him under his wing, and he's actually
                    come leaps and bounds since he arrived. </p>
                <p>He celebrates his name day on June 10, but still doesn't like to make a big deal out of it. Aidan
                    and Henry and the rest always plan something, however. </p>
                <p>Ania is still his biggest motivation since he doesn't want her to experience the pain he's gone
                    through. She can get him to come out of his shell the best of anyone. He's deeply grateful Min and
                    everyone, especially Sabah, for taking care of her when he couldn't. </p>
