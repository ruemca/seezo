                <div class="subcontent">
                    <p>Danny was born in county Wicklow, Ireland, to Seamus and Eireen McFarland. His sister, <a href="character-lana-mcfarland.html" title="Lana McFarland (character)">Lana</a>, was born when he was two. They lived as a relatively happy and comfortable family for several years, but Seamus was chronically ill and after a while could no longer work as a ship carpenter. As money ran low, they decided to send the children—six and four years old—to live with Eireen’s cousins in England. </p>
                    <p>The cousins were unwelcome to their Irish family, and became increasingly cruel. In the fall, as the young English cousins were preparing to go to boarding school, Danny stole some money from the house and ran away with Lana. They travelled south for a couple days, back to the docks where their boat had come from Ireland only a few months ago. They weren’t the only ones hiding around the docks, though—they discovered <a href="character-eliza-foster.html" title="Eliza Foster (character)">Eliza</a> watching them and eventually convinced her to join their cause. The three of them planned to stow away on a boat back to Ireland. When they overheard sailor with an Irish accent, they followed him to his ship and climbed aboard, but they didn’t realize his crew was actually bound for Germany. </p>
                    <p>The crew discovered their stowaways when Lana burst into tears with the realization that the boat wasn’t taking her back to her parents. Danny tried to argue that they should stand trial in Great Britain, but the crew didn’t want extra mouths to feed for any longer than they already had. As far as any of them can remember, a wagon took the children straight from the docks to the orphanage in Hamburg. </p>    
                    <p><a href="character-min-theopolis.html" title="Min Theopolis (character)">Min</a> and <a href="character-maja-csorba.html" title="Maja Csorba (character)">Maja</a> spoke no English when Danny, Lana, and Eliza arrived, but they immediately brought the new children into their corner. Danny was bookish like Maja, and he picked up German quickly with the books she leant him and helped him with. As a boy, Danny received more privilege at the orphanage than the other foreign children, and he was the first of them to find an apprenticeship, working at a shipyard in the city. He was still working there when Lana ran to tell him that Min had come back, and they were all going to Seezo. </p>

                <h2 class="subheading">Seezo and Hafen</h2>
                <div class="subcontent">
                    <p>Danny lived on Seezo for the first full year or so, but discovered he didn’t enjoy the farm work and isolation. He lived with the <a href="character-else-alfred-hofer.html" title="Else &amp; Alfred Hofer (characters)">Hofers</a> working on boats around the village, and spent some time with <a href="character-vera-trumbauer.html" title="Vera Trumbauer (character)">Vera</a>’s brother <a href="character-reiner-trumbauer.html" title="Reiner Trumbauer (character)">Reiner</a> in Hamburg, but eventually decided to join a crew himself. He worked on a large fishing boat, and then joined a crew taking goods to the British Isles. He took leave to look for his parents when they docked in Ireland, but he couldn’t trace what had happened to them. When he was in Dublin, however, he met a young boy named <a href="character-simon-elliot.html" title="Simon ELliot (character)">Simon</a> and quickly developed a soft spot for him. Simon was quiet, but Danny gathered that he had probably been abused and didn’t have a home to return to. Danny took the boy under his wing while waited in the city for the ship to Germany, and by the time it arrived he couldn’t bear to abandon him again. Danny bought another ticket, and Simon was happy to come with him. </p>
                    <p>Since returning to Germany, Danny spends about half the year living with Reiner and working in Hamburg, and the other half around Hafen and Seezo. He often stays with Hofers—they’ve adopted all the Seezo residents into their family, but Danny especially feels like their son. He also visits Vera more and more frequently, and on good occasions receives a kiss from her. </p>
