                <h1><span class="bookletter">a</span>nnelie Rasmussen</h1>
                <p>Curly white blonde hair contrasts and brings out stormy grey eyes, eyebrows so pale that you can
                    hardly
                    see them, but somehow she still manages to pull out a merciless glare; black jumper with faded
                    yellow
                    rosemaling</p>
                <p>Grew up with a band of fellow orphans in rural Denmark, surviving by stealing from surrounding
                    villages. (brothers Amund and Terje, Max, Annelie, Jarl, Felix, Oskar, Viggo, Kaj, Hugo, and baby
                    Jakob.) One of the older boys ended up committing murder, and the authorities were coming to break
                    up
                    the camp, so everyone scattered. Annelie fled south with Jakob and started stealing food again, but
                    they were caught. Min heard about the orphans who were being locked up in jail and convinced the
                    police
                    to let her take care of them instead of burdening the state. </p>
                <p>She was used to standing up for herself in a crowd of adolescent boys, so coming to Seezo was a bit
                    of a
                    shock to her system. She didn't want to be taken care of by anyone else to have strangers touch
                    Jakob,
                    so she resisted and rebelled. For the first few weeks, she scowled and snarled silently, while Min
                    and
                    Maja quietly approached her a few times. So far, she refuses to talk about their lives before the
                    mountain band, even to Jakob, though he asks incessantly. Min thinks getting her to talk about it
                    will
                    be important in getting her to trust them and adjust. </p>
                <p>She's smart and calculating, and often plans things out carefully, but she can also attack blindly
                    when
                    caught off guard. She became quite skilled at stealing food, but she'd always had a den to run back
                    to
                    in the mountains- once she was just on the streets in unfamiliar cities, she was caught. </p>
                <p>She often played the "decoy" in a heist, acting sweet and innocent to distract the victims
                    of a theft. Even now, it can be hard to tell when she's faking niceties to get something or truly
                    starting to soften up. She can also have mood swings sometimes, especially as a young adolescent-
                    she
                    started her period some time after coming to Seezo. </p>
                <p>She doesn't know her real birthday and refused to pick one when they suggested it, so Min picked
                    February 8, the day they arrived in Seezo. She got a black and yellow shawl to match her and
                    Jakob's clothes. </p>
