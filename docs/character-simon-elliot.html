                <h1><span class="bookletter">s</span>imon Elliot</h1>
                <p>Short sandy hair, droopy hazel eyes (like a cow), freckles, autistic, sticking-out ears</p>
                <p>Irish!</p>
                <p>He often looks sad and forlorn, and stares off into space while thinking. </p>
                <p>He talks very rarely, especially since he isn't a strong German speaker, so he mostly communicates
                    with
                    shrugs, facial expressions, and sighs. Johan often has to translate his body language, as well as
                    the
                    odd muddle of Danish and German that he has picked up. He'll talk more to Danny, Lana, and ELiza,
                    who
                    are native English speakers, as well as Maja and the H&uuml;bers since they can understand a bit
                    from
                    studying. He focuses (and communicates) best when his hands are distracted, so Johan taught him
                    some
                    knots to make with a piece of rope; otherwise he constantly clenches and unclenches his hands or
                    picks
                    at his skin. He also focuses well when sketching, which Charlotte has helped him practice. </p>
                <p>He was largely illiterate at first, but Elisabeth has worked her magic and helped him improve by
                    leaps
                    and bounds. </p>
                <p>He likes to play with wooden animal figures that Henry carves, especially a fox, a rabbit, and a
                    badger,
                    and often asks for specific animals on his birthday. </p>
                <p>He mostly does farm-type chores similar to what he did growing up, but he's also good at small-motor
                    tasks like preparing vegetables or setting fishing rods. </p>
