                <div class="subcontent">
                    <p>Minaria is the daughter of the gods <a href="character-persephone.html" title="Persephone (character)">Persephone</a> and <a href="character-hermes.html" title="Hermes (character)">Hermes</a>. Persephone was only a few months pregnant when she had to return to the Underworld at the end of summer. To hide her infidelity from Hades, she made herself lose the pregnancy just before the autumn equinox. It would have been a miscarriage, but of course, the child of two gods is immortal. Newborn Mina drifted in the Ionian Sea with her afterbirth until, suddenly, it broke apart in the water and formed a small island. </p>
                    <p>The baby and the island grew together. At first, it was bare except for a willow tree, from which she suckled sap. As days and years went by, the land slowly filled with plants and wildlife. Even the land itself expanded in size as Mina did. Hermes came to the island bearing a message for Mina when she was about five years old. He told her, with some regret, that she would have to leave the island. The gods, especially Zeus and Demeter, did not want her so close to the eyes and ears of Olympus where her discovery might invoke Hades' wrath. Mina grieved for her island, but agreed that she should move on to the land of mortals. Hermes carried her to the coast of Italy and sent her on her way. He also gave her a surname that she could use in the mortal realm: Theopolis, from <span class="italic">the&oacute;s</span> (god) and <span class="italic">p&oacute;lis</span> (city). Her middle name, Amona (from <span class="italic">m√≥na</span>, alone), she gave to herself at a later age. </p>
                    <p>Mina learned new things quickly among mortals‚Äîhow to wear clothes, to steal food, to speak their language. After a few days of culture shock, she met a group of children who said their families were also travelling north. The Roma travellers took her in cautiously</p>
                </div>
                <h2 class="subheading">Youth and Death</h2>
                <div class="subcontent">
                    <p>Like most gods, Min was mature and self-reliant almost from the time she was a baby. She left the caravan to continue heading north, away from Greece, and made her way alone all the way into northern Germany. A farmer offered her a ride into Hamburg and brought her to an orphanage. </p>
                    <p>Min tried to run away from the Hamburg orphanage several times, but she didn't have a way out of the city; someone always caught her. She also found a reason to stay: <a href="character-maja-csonkava.html" title="Maja Csonkava (character)">Maja</a>, <a href="character-danny-mcfarland.html" title="Danny McFarland (character)">Danny</a>, <a href="character-lana-mcfarland.html" title="Lana McFarland (character)">Lana</a>, and <a href="character-eliza-foster.html" title="Eliza Foster (character)">Eliza</a>. The orphanage was an unhappy place, but she decided to bide her time until they could find somewhere for all of them to escape together. </p>
                    <p>After a particularly nasty day when Min was 12, she ran away from the orphanage again, and finally managed to leave the city unseen. She travelled several miles until she came to a large estate owned by the wealthy H&uuml;ber family, which bordered on a forest. At the edge of the property, she found three-year-old <a href="character-sofia-huber.html"
                        title="Sofia H√ºber (character)">Sofia</a>, who had slipped away from her nurse, playing with a snake. Min coaxed the snake away and brought Sofia back to the big house. To show their gratitude, the H&uuml;bers let her stay for a night. Min liked the family, and convinced the cook to give her work as a kitchen maid. Sofia, however, did not forget about her hero. She pleaded to spend time with Min so often that Min became her nurse instead. </p>
                    <p>Min and Sofia became inseparable, and the other H&uuml;ber sisters <a href="character-elisabeth-huber.html"
                        title="Elisabeth H√ºber (character)">Elisabeth</a> and <a href="character-olya-huber.html"
                        title="Olya H√ºber (character)">Olya</a> began to think of her as a friend. Min wrote occasional letters to the Hamburg orphanage, careful to make sure the headmistress didn't find out. Min was still restless, but she loved Sofia too much to leave. The winter when Sofia was six and Min 16, Sofia fell into a fast-moving river. Min carried her out as fast as she could, but between her injuries and hypothermia, Sofia was going to die. Min wouldn‚Äôt allow it. She drew a ring of her own ichor on the ground around them, keeping Gethos from retrieving Sofia‚Äôs soul. Min tricked him with her ichor. She made him promise to let Sofia live in exchange for her own death that same day. He saw her ichor and thought it would be impossible, but he didn‚Äôt know Min‚Äôs history separated from the gods. </p>
                    <p>Because she never lived among the gods, Min only ate human food as a child, instead of the
                        ambrosia and nectar that provide substance for ichor. Whenever she bled, she lost some of the
                        ichor that she was born with, so by the time she was 16, she had very little in her
                        body. It was enough to convince <a href="character-gethos.html" title="Gethos (character)">Gethos</a>&mdash;the young chthonic god who came to collect Sofia&mdash;
                        she was immortal, so she tricked him into promising that if she died, he would bring Sofia back from the underworld. She cut herself,
                        letting the remaining ichor bleed out into the river, and drowned. Gethos saw her soul trying
                        to fall into the underworld, but it couldn't get through. No god had ever died before. No one
                        knew it was possible. </p>
                    <p>Gethos felt partly responsible for Min's death took it upon himself to lead her soul out of the Underworld and back to her body. Instead of the bank of the river, however, they ended up on a densely forested island. He didn't recognize it, but when Min finally came to, she knew intuitively that they were her islands‚Äîcreated from her birth‚Äîthat had kept growing while she'd been away. Spring came early and lasted long that year. As Min healed, she explored every inch of the islands and experimented with the limits of her own powers. Faced with the reality of her identity as a god, she made an effort to connect with her original family, but her mother remained out of reach. Hermes, always busy, didn't make much time to talk to her, but he did introduce her to his other young offspring, her half-brother <a href="character-heredes-theopolis.html" title="Heredes Theopolis (character)">Heredes</a>. Min invited Heredes to visit her islands during the day, and Gethos came at nightfall. </p>
                    <p>Gethos fell in love with her easily, but he was cautious to say anything. She fell in love more slowly, but with equal intensity. Their relationship was consensual, but there were always complexities in their difference in age and power, as well as lingering questions for Min over Sofia's fate. It became unhealthy when Min got pregnant, and Gethos refused the possibility of raising their children among mortals. He thought her feelings for him would overpower her love for her mortal companions, but her heart was committed to saving Sofia. She wanted to return to life with Maja and the other orphans. They fought over their future for months; eventually, she refused to see him. She spent more time with Heredes, who helped her begin building what would eventually by the Seezo Haus. She went into labor too early, as her mother had, and briefly held her twins, <a href="character-akonitia.html" title="Akonitia (character)">Akonitia</a> and <a href="character-mekonos.html" title="Mekonos (character)">Mekonos</a>, before Gethos took them away and left her with Sofia. </p>
                </div>
                <h2 class="subheading">Seezo</h2>
                <div class="subcontent">
                    <p>When Min left the islands with Sofia and Heredes, she discovered that they were no longer located in the Ionian Sea, but instead just off the coast of the Jutland Peninsula. They spent a few days in the coastal village of <a href="/loc-hafen.html" title="Hafen-auf-Gemensa (village)">Hafen</a>, ejoying the kindness of <a href="character-else-alfred-hofer.html" title="Else and Alfred Hofer (characters)">Alfred and Else Hofer</a> and young <a href="character-vera-trumbauer.html" title="Vera Traumbauer (character)">Vera Trumbauer</a>. Then they spent the fall reconnecting with friends in the mortal realm: Elizabeth and Olya, Maja, Danny, Lana, and Eliza. Each of them agreed to join the group in their new home on the islands. They stayed the winter with the Hofers and moved to the island in the spring. Min had always called the islands <span class="italic">Œ£œÄŒØœÑŒπ</span> (<span class="italic">sp√≠ti</span>), meaning home, but Sofia chose the name Seezo beause of the lake (<span class="italic">See</span> in German) next to their new house. </p>
                    <p>x At this point, her immortality is certain, but her health can still fail. She occasionally eats
                        ambrosia from Gethos or Henry, but she can't eat a lot because it can overwhelm her body and
                        make her feel ill because she's become used to having more red blood. She's also still learning
                        the extent of her power as a god. Since she's never been to Olympus, no one knows her domain
                        and no one has taught her how to find her power except Heredes and Gethos. She can create plant
                        life, communicate with animals, and especially influence aspects of Seezo, like the earth and
                        the weather&mdash;but influencing things also tends to sap her strength. </p>
                    <p>x Because of her unusual death, she's stuck in her 16-year-old, which has bothered her more and
                        more as she actually gets older. Strangers often treat her like an even younger child because
                        she's so short. If she had been stuck just a bit older, she thinks, it might not be so
                        conspicuous. However, most people who know her for some time come to realize quickly that
                        there's more to her than meets the eye. </p>
                    <p>x Sometimes, she regrets that she can't explore the islands every day like she used to, and some
                        days, she misses the independence she had when she was alone. But, of course, she's still glad
                        for everyone and wouldn't go back to that time for the world. There are times when she
                        disappears to wander the woods or visit the old islands, but they all trust her to come back
                        when she's ready. Other times, she leads everyone on hikes to new parts of the isle. </p>
                    <p>The structure of the Seezo family is big and loose, but everyone else easily considers her the
                        central presence. When she's gone for long periods of time, the rest of them feel that
                        something is missing. For most of them, she's kind of a maternal, or at least familial, figure.
                        She and Maja have a
                        quiet relationship that neither of them quite want to label, but could be romantic, and
                        sometimes more intimate when they find rare moments when they're really alone. Min doesn't have
                        a label for her sexuality, but she feels attraction regardless of gender. </p>
                    <p>Maja has helped Min recognize the ways that her relationship with Gethos was (and is)
                        manipulative and unhealthy. She has a hard time cutting him off completely, because he will
                        take her down to the underworld sometimes to visit Akonitia and Mekonos. </p>

                    <p>As Min grew into her power, her affect on those around her also grew. Too many lost children came to Hafen. Too many of the people she loved felt melancholy and restless. Min's job is to let people confront their grief and learn to live with it, and to protect children when they have no other family. She is not meant to be in people's lives for very long. After many decades on Seezo, the family the orphans had created began to drift apart. Danny married Vera. Lana and Eliza moved to the mainland. Olya and Johan went to Denmark. Sofia asked to return to the Underworld. Elisabeth went to Hamburg. Heredes returned to Olympus, and tried to make Min follow him. She refused. She and Maja decided to travel. </p>
