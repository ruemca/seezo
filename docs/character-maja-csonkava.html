                <div class="subcontent">
                    <p>Maja is the daughter of Sinti Roma travellers Mariska and Jenö Csonka. She grew up in her family's caravan until she was about six years old, when they were camped near Hamburg. A mob of Hamburgers set their wagons on fire and attacked the people living there. She saw at least one of her uncles beat to death, and lost her parents in the frenzy. Someone brought the children who were left to the orphanage in Hamburg—Maja and two boys a little older than her. She didn't know where the other Roma children ended up. The headmistress at the orphanage harshly discouraged the three Roma from interacting, and the boys left with in a couple years—one to work, and one she didn't know. Maja stayed, because she didn't have anywhere else to go. The headmistress gave her endless grief for being Roma, as did the other German orphans. She learned to close off her emotions, and became a particularly quiet, observant child. She followed rules to a tee and spent most of her time alone, studying the few books that she had access to. </p>
                    <p>When <a href="character-min-theopolis.html" title="Min Theopolis (character)">Min</a> arrived at the orphanage, she and Maja gravitated toward eachother immediately. Min was also bullied for her lack of German and her foreign appearance. Maja helped Min learn to speak and read German, and Min shared everything that she had learned before the orphanage. When <a href="character-danny-mcfarland.html" title="Danny McFarland (character)">Danny</a>, <a href="character-lana-mcfarland.html" title="Lana McFarland (character)">Lana</a>, and <a href="character-eliza-foster.html" title="Eliza Foster (character)">Eliza</a> arrived, Min and Maja welcomed them into their circle. </p>
                    <p>Min was always bent on leaving the orphanage, but Maja didn't want to leave without any security of long-term food and shelter&mdash;always the practical thinker. Min promised that when she ran away, she would come find Maja and the others as soon as she found somewhere for them to be together. Maja received a few cryptic letters from Min while she worked for the H&uuml;bers, but never an opportunity to leave herself. When she was around 13-14, Maja sought work as an assistant and apprentice to a local nurse midwife, and left the orphanage. She worked there until Min came back, when she was 16, and offered for them to live together on Seezo Island. </p>
                </div>
                <h2 class="subheading">Seezo</h2>
                <div class="subcontent">
                    <p>Maja is much happier on Seezo than she ever imagined being. She's still a reserved and quiet person, but she's working on breaking down the emotional walls that she built as a child. She puts all her nursing skills to use caring for her Seezo family, as well as assisting people on the mainland during bad seasons of sickness. Her emotional detachment lends itself to caretaking, but it can also keep her more distant than she likes. She is most open with the other older Seezo crew, especially Min. </p>
                    <p>Maja doesn't pretend to understand how Min's body works, but she tries to make sure the she's taking care of herself mentally and physically. Min does the same for her. Maja can hide her concern pretty well, but she becomes noticably anxious when Min is gone for too long, especially when <a href="character-gethos.html" title="Gethos (character)">Gethos</a> is involved. Although she's never met him, Maja has quite a personal grudge against Gethos for his mistreatment of Min. </p>
                    <p>She doesn't like having attention on herself, and always tries to convince the others to ignore things like her birthday, but Min would never let that happen. She's very much in love with Min, and has been since they were children. She doesn't think she's ever fancied anyone else. They like to keep their relationship subtle, but really everyone knows how close they are. </p>
