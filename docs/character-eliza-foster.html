                <div class="subcontent">
                    <p>Eliza was in England as a child. She couldn't tell you more than that. When she was about 6, she was severely injured in a fire and suffered long term amnesia. She ended up at the piers in Portsmouth, where she begged and scavenged for food and tried to recover from her extensive burns and other injuries. After some little time, she noticed two kids about her age—<a href="character-danny-mcfarland.html" title="Danny McFarland (character)">Danny</a> and <a href="character-lana-mcfarland.html" title="Lana McFarland (character)">Lana</a>—hanging around the same dock, and quickly became their ally. The three of them planned to stow away on a boat back to Ireland. When they overheard sailor with an Irish accent, they followed him to his ship and climbed aboard, but they didn’t realize his crew was actually bound for Germany. </p>
                    <p>Eliza stuck close with the McFarlands, while they were found out by the crew and brought ashore to an orphanage in Hamburg. At first she wouldn't talk to any of the other orphans, but <a href="character-min-theopolis.html" title="Min Theopolis (character)">Min</a> and <a href="character-maja-Csonkava.html" title="Maja Csonkava (character)">Maja</a> were patient enough to win her trust and learn a few words of English. Lana picked up German quicker than Eliza and helped her navigate their new lives, making the two of them even more inseparable than before. Maja tried to find ways to fix Eliza's burns, but they were far too old then to properly remedy. Her right shoulder and back were covered in scar tissue and part of her face was disfigured, causing her to begin going blind shortly after arriving in Hamburg. </p>
                    <p>Eliza's amnesia was severe, but she did begin to recover snippets of memory. Some images she would dream, and some images would come back as if triggered, but she was always uncertain of their accuracy. She didn't tell anyone about her possible memories except Lana, and only after many years. </p>
                    <p>Eliza stayed on at the orphanage after her friends left for jobs elsewhere, held back by people who assumed a disabled girl didn't have any skills. In fact, she was always skilled with her hands and became an excellent cook. She and Lana worked many hours together in the orphanage kitchen before Lana was pushed to find an outside job. Left on her own, the other kitchen workers at first tried to abuse and take advantage of Eliza, but they quickly learned she didn't need to see to be able to use a knife on anything. </p>

                <h2 class="subheading">Seezo</h2>
                <div class="subcontent">
                    <p>Still working in the kitchen, Eliza was the first of the orphans that Min told about her plans to have a home on Seezo, and Eliza didn't hesitate to leave. She led Min to Lana and Maja, and soon the crew was back together and headed to the Hüber house and to Hafen. Eliza was overwhelmed with joy to have her friends around her again. </p>
                    <p>Eliza is generally quiet and aloof by nature, and by the traumatic experiences she's survived. She likely won't speak in someone's presence if she doesn't know them personally. With friends, though, and especially with Lana, she's funny and sweet and quite opinionated. She remains mostly blind but can see a minimal amount of shape and shadows. Although she can't make out her reflection, she's acutely self-conscious of her appearance. She doesn't like to bathe or change where other people can see the scars that her clothes cover. She knows how to arrange her hair with a fringe covering her disfigured ear, although she will allow Lana to tuck yellow flowers behind her ear if she's assured that they're particularly pretty. </p>
                    <p>Although she's been assured she can retire from the kitchen whenever she wants, Eliza continues to be the main cook for the Seezo family, and generally prefers to remain in the house most of the day. When Lana isn't chattering to the plants and animals outside, she stays with Eliza doing housework as well. The two of them don't consider themselves to be a couple, but they certainly don't plan on spending more than a few minutes apart any time soon. </p>
