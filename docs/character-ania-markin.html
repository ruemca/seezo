                <h1><span class="bookletter">a</span>nia Markin</h1>
                <p>Born in a small village in western Russia to a severely depressed woman with four children (Alexei
                    the
                    oldest, twins Lyuba and Nikolai, and Ania the youngest). When Nikolai died their mother went crazy
                    with
                    grief. Nearly 2 years later their house burned down (most likely set on fire by mother), killing
                    both
                    parents as well as Lyuba. Alexei escaped with Ania and went west, eventually ending up in Lithuania
                    and
                    begging fare on a cargo ship to Denmark. </p>
                <p>Her big round, dark eyes always make her look innocent and awe-struck by whatever's going on. She
                    wears
                    a little red and white kerchief like Sabah's and a traditional Russian dress that Elisabeth let out
                    as
                    she's gotten older (since she wore it from Russia), but she's grown so much now they are trying to
                    copy
                    the pattern to fit her as she grows more. </p>
                <p>She learned German relatively quickly since she was young, but she still has a small accent or
                    speech
                    impediment. </p>
                <p>She doesn't remember much about Russia or their family, but Alexei worries that she could develop
                    depression or bipolar similar to him and their mother. She views Alexei as a guardian and likes to
                    run
                    up to him and give him a hug, or jump so he'll catch her. When Alexei fell apart, Sabah took her
                    under
                    her wing, so Ania sees her as a guardian and sister figure as well. She loves to go on piggy back
                    rides
                    and sit on people's shoulders, especially Alexei and Sabah (it makes her feel taller). </p>
                <p>Strawberries are her favorite food- sometimes for shortcake, sometimes on bread in the morning, but
                    always strawberries. Eliza always saves a jar of preserves for her name day on April 8, which she
                    celebrates instead of her birthday. </p>
