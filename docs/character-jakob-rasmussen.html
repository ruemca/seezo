                <h1><span class="bookletter">j</span>akob Rasmussen</h1>
                <p>White blond hair slightly yellower than Annelie, thick but not curly, and a bit shaggy and choppy
                    from
                    the rudimentary haircuts they managed in the mountains; brown eyes, ruddy cheeks, black vest with
                    faded
                    yellow rosemaling and red scarf</p>
                <p>Grew up with a band of fellow orphans in rural Denmark, surviving by stealing from surrounding
                    villages. (brothers Amund and Terje, Max, Annelie, Jarl, Felix, Oskar, Viggo, Kaj, Hugo, and baby
                    Jakob.) One of the older boys ended up committing murder, and the authorities were coming to break
                    up
                    the camp, so everyone scattered. Annelie fled south with Jakob and started stealing food again, but
                    they were caught. Min heard about the orphans who were being locked up in jail and convinced the
                    police
                    to let her take care of them instead of burdening the state. </p>
                <p>He was the youngest in the Mountain Band by far, often considered the &ldquo;baby,&rdquo; so Annelie
                    sheltered him from most of the crime. He was very excited to meet boys close to his own age at
                    Seezo
                    and have real friends to play with. He can be nervous about trying new things, but he's generally
                    willing to jump in head first. He's usually cheerful and has a lopsided grin from his baby teeth
                    falling out. He's also na&iuml;ve and doesn't get subtle meanings hidden in conversation. </p>
                <p>He's a decent cook, since he wasn't allowed to help with robberies and therefore had to stay back
                    and
                    help make meals most days. He loves food, and when Eliza said she could make him a feast for his
                    birthday, his eyes got huge- he thinks she must be a witch to make so much food at once. </p>
                <p>He doesn't remember their family at all, so he regards Annelie as a mother figure as well as a
                    sister.
                    However, he's still curious about their parents and questions her incessantly. He loved listening
                    to
                    stories around the campfire in the mountains from Annelie and the other boys, and Elisabeth has
                    used
                    some of these stories to teach him to read and write. </p>
                <p>He was fascinated with all the animals when he first got to Seezo, especially cats, since he'd never
                    seen them so tame before. </p>
