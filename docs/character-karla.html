                <h1><span class="bookletter">k</span>arla</h1>
                <p>Thick sandy hair in tight braids, big blue eyes, dimples, still baby faced and childish, always
                    wears
                    Tyrolean hat</p>
                <p>Karolina was born in a cheap inn just outside of Hamburg. A man staying next door heard her wailing
                    for
                    several hours before he forced open the room and discovered the baby in the arms of her dead
                    mother. He
                    asked the inn-keeper, who didn't know anything, and then brought the baby and all the mother's
                    belongings to Vera, who he knew through a friend. He named her Karolina after his sister who had
                    died
                    in childbirth some years before, and Alena Bachmeier after the name her mother had given to the
                    inn-keeper. The mother's things were Bavarian style, including a Tyrolean hat and dirndl, so they
                    assumed she'd come from the south. Vera let her wear the hat as much as she wanted, but keeps the
                    dirndl and other clothes tucked away until Karla is old enough to wear them. </p>
                <p>She's not yet very curious about her family's origins, and doesn't think much about her mother,
                    mostly
                    because she never knew anyone but Vera as a guardian. </p>
                <p>She never goes anywhere without her hat, and always collects different feathers to stick in the rim.
                    Sometimes she braids feathers into her hair, and once even made a feather mobile for Hennie and
                    Drika's
                    birthday. </p>
                <p>She's bossy and talkative, and likes to get her way. She threw temper tantrums as a toddler, but has
                    gradually learned to share and take turns. She was one of the earliest children Vera raised, and by
                    far
                    the youngest at the time, so she didn't know how to discipline her properly. She always asks for
                    candy
                    or pastries on her birthday to satisfy her sweet tooth. </p>
                <p>It's her job to milk the cow and collect eggs, but when she's older Vera wants to teach her to bake
                    so
                    she can make the pastries she loves for everyone. </p>
