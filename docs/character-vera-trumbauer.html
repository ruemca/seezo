                <h2 class="subheading">Early Life and Childhood</h2>
                <div class="subcontent">
                    <p>Vera was born in <a href="/loc-hafen.html" title="Hafen-auf-Gemensa (village)">Hafen-auf-Gemensa</a> to Alberecht and Carina Trumbauer. Alberecht was a stonemason from another hamlet near the Gemensa river, and Carina was a renound singer in the village who grew up on a farm on the outskirts of Hafen. Vera and her older brother <a href="character-reiner-trumbauer.html" title="Reiner Traumbauer (character)">Reiner</a> spent many months with their grandfather Hans on the farm as they grew up. Reiner left for Hamburg to be a blacksmith's apprentice when he was 15, and Vera chose to spend more and more time on Hans' farm. By the time she was 14, she essentially ran the place with him. </p>
                    <p>Hans' farm neighbors on the <a href="character-else-alfred-hofer.html" title="Else and Alfred Hofer (characters)">Hofers</a>' land, and Alfred and Else were like another set of godparents for Vera and Reiner. They share tools, seeds, and advice, and come over for dinner at least every few days. When <a href="character-min-theopolis.html" title="Min Theopolis (character)">Min</a>, <a href="character-heredes-theopolis.html" title="Heredes Theopolis (character)">Heredes</a>, and <a href="character-sofia-huber.html" title="Sofia HÃ¼ber (character)">Sofia</a> came up the Gemensa river from Seezo, they landed at the dock that the farmers used. They asked the Hofers for a drink and directions to Hamburg, but the couple could see that the travellers were exhausted and unprepared for any kind of journey. The more they all talked over dinner, the more endeared they all became to each other. The travellers ended up spending the better part of a week with the Hofers and Trumbauers, so Min could take more time to regain her strength after childbirth and Sofia could better adjust to the living. Vera was about 12 years old at the time, and very enamored of the older girl. </p>
                    <p>In late fall, Min returned to Hafen with her friends after about a month away. Vera (and the Hofers) wouldn't hear of the crew trying to start their homestead alone all winter, and it didn't take much convincing for them to agree to stay until the thaw. Hans, Alfred, and Else quickly became like the elders most of the crew had never had, and Vera fit well in as a little sister. By spring, they were sorry to part, but Vera was assured they wouldn't be long without a visit. The Seezo crew brought their friends to the island so they could help build and set up the new farm quickly. </p>

                <div class="subcontent">
                    <p>Vera became close with the young </p>
                    <p>foster girls!</p>
                </div> <!-- end .subcontent -->
                <p>When Hans died, she planted roses outside the farmhouse in his honor. On her birthday one year, her
                    foster girls decorated the whole farm with wildflowers, with daisy chains for all the animals. </p>
                <p>Her hands are always red and raw from scrubbing laundry, which Min always worries over. Maja has
                    tried a
                    few different remedies to heal them, to varying success. </p>
                <p>She's always been a bit eccentric, wearing bright, mismatched colors and wild hair. However, she has
                    just the right ratio of sanity and lunacy to be a perfect mother figure- she's amazing with little
                    kids. She used to want children of her own, but she's become content with the foster family she has
                    now. </p>
                <p>She gives all her girls, and the Seezo ones, a proper education about womanhood and their bodies.
                </p>
                <p>She loves to sing and especially dance. </p>
