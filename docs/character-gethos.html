                <p>Gethos is a young chthonic god, or a god of the Underworld. He assists Thanatos and <a href="character-hermes.html" title="Hermes (character)">Hermes</a> with the collection of souls of the dead; specifically, he deals with cases in which souls are slow to leave the mortal realm or linger too close to death. Such cases include people with chronic fatal illnesses, brain death, or those with especially strong connections to those they leave behind. He ensures that these people pass on to the Underworld at the appropriate time, not too early or too late. </p>
                <p><a href="character-sofia-huber.html" title="Sofia Hüber (character)">Sofia</a>'s death caught Gethos' attention because Min attempted to extend her life by warding away the psychopomps with her own immortality. Gethos didn't know <a href="character-min-theopolis.html" title="Min Theopolis (character)">Mina</a>, but recognized her divinity, and reasoned with her that she could not extend the life of someone already given to death. He accepted her bargain—Sofia's life for her own—because it seemed like an easy way to placate her and get his way. When he saw Min's soul struggling to enter the Underworld shortly thereafter, he realized his mistake. </p>
                <p>Gethos fell in love with Min as he helped her heal. He came to visit her every night, travelling at dusk and dawn. He saw Min's childhood—her suffering and suicide—as evidence that gods should not coexist with mortals on earth. When Min became pregnant, it seemed obvious to him that their children should be raised among other gods. He brushed off Min's protest as youthful naivete and refused to budge, even when he watched her hold their twins, <a href="character-akonitia.html" title="Akonitia (character)">Akonitia</a> and <a href="character-mekonos.html" title="Mekonos (character)">Mekonos</a>, with all her tenderness and love. </p>
