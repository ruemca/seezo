                <!--p>Born to an African woman named Amina somewhere in Italy or Northern Africa. She lived in some state of Italian slavery until Sabah was about 4 years old, at which point their master decided to sell Sabah in Bavaria. They travelled north into Germany, but the man was no longer interested in buying her by the time they reached his estate, so the Italian kept her with him as he continued to Duisburg, where he had business. Eventually, Sabah escaped blindly north and ended up on the coast, where Min took care of  her. </p-->
                <p>Slavery in Germany is not as pervasive as in other parts of the world, or later in history, but
                    Sabah is
                    certainly a racial minority and Min takes care to protect of her, and doesn't let her go to town
                    alone.
                    Sabah has become increasingly self-concious of race with age, and she's had some discussions with
                    Min
                    and Maja about it; however, no one on Seezo takes much notice of her skin color after a while. For
                    some
                    of the younger foreign children who'd never seen a black person, it was a curiosity initially, but
                    wore
                    off quickly. </p>
                <p>She left her mother too young to know much about North African culture or Islam, but she still wears
                    a
                    headscarf because that's how her mom always looked. She has a small scrap of green fabric torn from
                    the
                    hem of her mother's dress. </p>
                <p>She doesn't know her exact birthday, so she picked the first day she ever saw snow. She was so
                    excited
                    and curious and wouldn't stop staring out the window at the flakes coming down. She's gotten
                    assorted
                    gifts, including a book of Arabian Nights tales and small jewelry. She adores the wintertime
                    because of
                    the snow, and wants to go outside when almost no one else will to visit the goats and run around.
                    However, she also gets cold easily, and snuggles up in blankets in the evening before bed, and
                    wears
                    fingerless gloves most of the time. </p>
                <p>She loves to go out and watch the sheep with Miriam or by herself, and usually sings with the birds
                    or
                    to the sheep. </p>
                <p>She took Ania under her wing when she arrived because Alexei couldn't. Ania had so much energy and
                    they
                    immediately clicked, and she would take her around the farm and they would watch the goats
                    together.
                    Later as Alexei began to recover they spent time together, so she can tease him and cheer him up.
                </p>
                <p>She taught Miriam the Arabic and Italian mixture that she remembers, and Miriam taught her some
                    Yiddish,
                    so they can communicate in their own secret pidgin language when they want. Ania has also picked up
                    some of the words, so sometimes only they can fully understand her. </p>
