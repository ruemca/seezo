                <h1><span class="bookletter">h</span>ennie</h1>
                <p>Thin strawberry blonde hair usually in braids or pigtails, clear blue eyes</p>
                <p>Identical twins abandoned on the steps of a Dutch nunnery when they were figured to be around a week
                    old, with unknown origins. The orphanage was under quarantine and couldn't have new children, so
                    they
                    begged townspeople to take them in. Eventually, Min and Vera took pity and brought them home. </p>
                <p>Hennie is slightly larger and steadier, but Drika is the &ldquo;dominant&rdquo; twin and
                    speaks/initiates more. They were both very colicky in their first year or so. They're rarely seen
                    out
                    of each other's company, and usually can be seen holding hands, sitting knee-to-knee or
                    back-to-back.
                </p>
                <p>Originally Min was going to take them, but she got busy with Simon and then Sabah and Miriam, so
                    Vera
                    took over and let Anika, who had recently arrived, help out. They spend lots of time playing on
                    their
                    own, but Anika still ensures that they get all their schooling- she tells them stories and helps
                    them
                    read in particular. They like to play with Emily's paper dolls, but Vera says they're too young to
                    have
                    a set of their own. Their favorite time of year is early spring, when the baby chicks hatch. Vera
                    is
                    starting to give them more responsibility, and lets them be primary caretakers for the chicks,
                    keeping
                    watch and running around in the pen. </p>
                <p>They know both German and Danish quite well, as well as bits of English and Estonian from growing up
                    around all of Vera's girls. They don't have a made-up language of their own, but sometimes they
                    talk in
                    such a jumbled mix of vocabulary and grammar that it takes a lot of group work to know what they're
                    saying. </p>
