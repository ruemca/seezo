                <div class="subcontent">
                    <p>Lana was born in county Wicklow, Ireland, to Seamus and Eireen McFarland. Her brother, <a href="character-danny-mcfarland.html" title="Danny McFarland (character)">Danny</a>, is two years older. They lived as a relatively happy and comfortable family for a couple years, but Seamus was chronically ill and after a while could no longer work as a ship carpenter. As money ran low, they decided to send the children—four and six years old—to live with Eireen’s cousins in England. </p>
                    <p>The cousins were unwelcome to their Irish family, and became increasingly cruel. In the fall, as the young English cousins were preparing to go to boarding school, Danny stole some money from the house and ran away with Lana. They travelled south for a couple days, back to the docks where their boat had come from Ireland only a few months ago. They weren’t the only ones hiding around the docks, though—they discovered <a href="character-eliza-foster.html" title="Eliza Foster (character)">Eliza</a> watching them and eventually convinced her to join their cause. The three of them planned to stow away on a boat back to Ireland. When they overheard sailor with an Irish accent, they followed him to his ship and climbed aboard, but they didn’t realize his crew was actually bound for Germany. </p>
                    <p>The crew discovered their stowaways when Lana burst into tears with the realization that the boat wasn’t taking her back to her parents. Danny tried to argue that they should stand trial in Great Britain, but the crew didn’t want extra mouths to feed for any longer than they already had. As far as any of them can remember, a wagon took the children straight from the docks to the orphanage in Hamburg. </p>    
                    <p><a href="character-min-theopolis.html" title="Min Theopolis (character)">Min</a> and <a href="character-maja-Csonkava.html" title="Maja Csonkava (character)">Maja</a> spoke no English when Danny, Lana, and Eliza arrived, but they immediately brought the new children into their corner. Lana was outgoing and eager to learn everything about the new friends, and over the years she became especially close with Eliza. Although she was upset to be completely disconnected from her parents, she developed a skill for creating space for joy in every situation, no matter how bleak. As the group grew up and the older children found work outside the orphanage, Lana stayed there with Eliza as long as she could. When they no longer needed her in the kitchens, she started nannying and teaching the younger orphans. When Min returned to the orphanage, she saw Lana first, and Lana ran to the shipyard tell her brother that they were all leaving the city. </p>

                <div class="subcontent">
                    <p>Lana’s sense of optimism has become less whimsical and more down-to-earth as she’s lived on Seezo. She still loves to make people smile, but now it feels like fun rather than disaster relief. She most often stays in the house where Eliza likes to work. She likes to talk and sing while her hands are busy, and Eliza will happily let her chatter for hours. She puts birdseed out every day to attract songbirds, and talks to them as if they can understand her, which makes Min and Henry laugh. Sometimes they translate for her, but usually she likes to do it her own way. Lana’s laugh is by far the best on Seezo—forceful and sincere and exceptionally contagious. </p>
