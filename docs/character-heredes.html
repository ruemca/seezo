                    <p>Heredes is the child of <a href="character-hermes.html" title="Hermes (character)">Hermes</a> and Thalia, the Grace of joy and abundance. He was raised mostly by his mother and her sisters in the retinue of Aphrodite, travelling to Olympus occasionally for the rituals of the gods. As a child, he saw his busy father very seldom. </p>
                    <p>Most gods know their domain intrinsically by a young age. Heredes knew around 14 years old, relatively late but not unheard of. He encompasses forms of love that fall outside the traditionally celebrated romance: platonic, familial, self, and queer love. His gender is fluid. Heredes has had many names among the Seezo family: 'Here' or Harry became Henry or Henrik, and when she feels more feminine, Henne or Rike. They're happy for others to read them as masculine by default, but usually people who know best can tell when Heredes wants to be Here or Rike. </p>
                    <p>He learned about <a href="character-min-theopolis.html" title="Min Theopolis (character)">Min</a> when? Despite his familiarity with farming, he also lived a pampered life among the gods- it was still a shock to his system to work so hard for so little on Seezo. </p>
                </div> <!-- end of .subcontent -->
                <p>On the solstice days every winter and summer, they must attend the gatherings of all the gods on Olympus. Heredes has mixed feelings about his relationship with the Olympians in light of Min's absence from these gatherings. He always tries to bring up her name with the other gods, or suggest she go to them herself, but neither party seems interested in chaning the way things stand. </p>
                <p>He's very protective of Min and treats her like a kid sometimes, even though she's technically older, and vastly more experienced with almost everything in the mortal world. He feels badly for never knowing her when they were younger, although it wasn't his fault. </p>
                <p>He's skilled at whittling, and makes lots of tools, utensils, toys, and instruments, often as
