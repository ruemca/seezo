                <h2 class="subheading">Early Life and Childhood</h2>
                <div class="subcontent">
                    <p>Olya is the middle child of the H&uuml;bers, a wealthy German family with an estate just outside of Hamburg. She and her sister <a href="character-elisabeth-huber.html" title="Elisabeth Hüber (character)">Elisabeth</a>, three years her senior, were raised together by nurses and governesses. Elisabeth was a model ladylike girl, and Olya could never live up to the standard set by her sister, so eventually she stopped trying. Olya was loud, rambunctious, and impatient; she liked to run around the estate grounds, especially on horseback, and didn't pay attention to whether her clothes tore. Both sisters are beautiful, but people always commented that Elisabeth was moreso&mdash;Olya's features are slightly sharper and thinner. She stopped wearing her hair down because she thought she looked too much like her sister. Her personality was always different, but the comparison between them exacerbated Olya's jealousy and made her particularly rebellious. Their youngest sister, <a href="character-sofia-huber.html" title="Sofia Hüber (character)">Sofia</a>, was born when she was seven. </p>
                    <p><a href="character-min-theopolis.html" title="Min Theopolis (character)">Min</a> came to work for the H&uuml;bers when Olya was nine, and Min was 12. On their first meeting, Olya was quite rude to Min, but she warmed to her quickly when Min proved to be patient and understanding where the rest of her family was often disparaging. They became friendly, but not particularly close; Olya considered Min more of a wise teacher, being a few years older. Min also helped mediate arguments between the sisters occasionally, encouraging them to try repairing their relationship. When Sofia died, Elisabeth initially blamed Min, while Olya defended her. When Min disappeared, the whole family fell apart with grief, and the sisters tried hard to maintain common ground. </p>
                    <p>Olya struggled with her identity after the losses. She had never been so quiet, or so introspective. Elisabeth planned to go away to a convent, but Olya fought for them to stay together. When Min returned and recalled Sofia from the underworld, offering them a place for all of them to go away together, Olya jumped at the offer and eventually convinced Elisabeth to come too. </p>
                </div>
                <h2 class="subheading">Seezo</h2>
                <div class="subcontent">
                    <p>Olya has become much happier and less tempermental since moving away from her parents, although everyone still knows to be careful around her when she's in a bad mood. She enjoys the physical work of farming and taking care of animals that she can throw herself into. She's the primary caretaker of the horses on the island, and prefers to do any kind of work outdoors. </p>
                    <p>Her relationship with Elisabeth (and Sofia) has also grown much healthier since she doesn't feel compared to or constricted by them any more. She now considers Elisabeth her closest friend. They are each others' favorite dance partners, and like to ride the horses around the island together. Sofia is so different from her&mdash;so quiet and reserved&mdash;that she has never felt particularly close to her youngest sister, but she's happy to see Sofia thrive with Min. </p>
                    <p>When Seezo's first foster child <a href="character-johan-fisker.html" title="Johan Fisker (character)">Johan</a> arrived, Olya found him highly annoying, especially because he always wanted to be in the same place as her. He had an obvious crush on her and she teased him about it relentlessly—until she finally admitted she liked him too. They each have a different kind of chaotic energy, but they seem to balance each other out. </p> <!-- #bi4bi couple -->

                <h2 class="subheading">After Seezo</h2>
                <div class="subcontent">
                    <p>After 10 years or so, when both Johan and Olya are in their 20s, they get married. At first, they build a small hut near the Seezo Haus just for the two of them, but after a while they get restless. They travel for a little while in France, and then come back to start their own farm near Hafen. Olya has her horses and Johan has his fishing. Pretty soon, they also have their babies. They don't live too far away from Lacht Haus, which eventually becomes the hub of the extended family once everyone else moves away from Seezo. </p>
