                <div class="subcontent">
                    <p>Sofia is the youngest child of the H&uuml;bers, a wealthy German family with an estate just outside of Hamburg. Her sisters <a href="character-elisabeth-huber.html" title="Elisabeth Hüber (character)">Elisabeth</a> and <a href="character-olya-huber.html" title="Olya Hüber (character)">Olya</a> were ten and seven when she was born. Like her sisters, Sofia was raised by nurses and nannies, but her caretakers often had trouble with her as a baby. She was a collicky baby, unusually upset by small things, and didn't begin to babble or laugh as babies normally do; at three years old she still hadn't said her first word. By this age, Sofia's nurse began to speculate loudly about the child being dumb and made increasingly careless choices with her charge, and the Hübers fired her. </p>
                    <p>Sofia's second nurse was inexperienced and soon revealed that she didn’t know how to take care of a high-needs child. One afternoon when Sofia was three, this nurse had taken her out into the garden and fallen asleep, leaving the toddler unattended. Whether by fate or by fortune (and the fates would tell) <a href="character-min-theopolis.html" title="Min Theopolis (character)">Min</a> had ran away from Hamburg, and ended up in the Hüber’s garden that day. She spent the afternoon playing with Sofia, and by the end of the day, she was Sofia’s new favorite person. The Hübers allowed Min to stay on as part of the downstairs staff, but between Sofia’s insistence and Min’s skill with children, she soon became Sofia’s new full time nanny. </p>
                    <p>Sofia remained mostly non-verbal her whole life, which didn't pose a problem for those that knew her well, like Min and her sisters. Sofia loved Min because she knew what she wanted intrinsically. If Sofia didn't want the food on her plate, Min would take her to the kitchens and make something familiar. She sang ancient Greek ballads and lullabies that the Earth had sung when she was a baby. She let Sofia explore as much of the world as she wanted, get dirty and smile broadly and shriek with delight. Sofia trusted Min with her life. </p>
                    <p>The winter when Sofia was six and Min 16, Sofia slipped and tumbled into a swift-moving river. Min carried her out as fast as she could, but between her injuries and hypothermia, Sofia was quickly dying. Min wouldn’t allow it. When <a href="character-gethos.html" title="Gethos (character)">Gethos</a>—the shepherd of lingering souls—came to collect Sofia, Min fooled him into letting her die in exchange for Sofia’s life. However, because Min could not escape her own immortal soul, it wasn’t so simple an exchange. Sofia spent about a year in the Underworld before Gethos finally allowed her to return to Min in the land of the living. </p>

                <h2 class="subheading">Seezo</h2>
                <div class="subcontent">
                    <p>Sofia's death didn’t come without a cost. Physically, she never aged past six years old, and she always kept Gethos’ lead pendant around her neck to keep the other gods of the Underworld from bothering her. She was always cold; wool scarves and crackling fires helped, but never entirely. And although she continued to develop mentally as she grew older, she always remained detached from the rest of Seezo, as she felt drawn to the realm of Hades. She had a hard time focusing with large groups of people, and often goes out on her own (humming all the while) or stays close to one specific person—usually Min, or her sisters. Min had a hard time seeing Sofia as an adult, instead of a child she has to take care of, but Sofia was always quick to remind her. Sofia also had complicated feelings about Min bringing her out of the Underworld. </p>
                    <p>When Sofia was still a child, she liked to play with the other kids that came to Seezo—Johan, Simon, and Miriam. However, as they grew up and went on to live adult lives, she remained in the body of a child. She harbored ambitions, and crushes, but couldn't act on them. She became more and more uncomfortable and withdrawn, until she finally asked Min and Gethos to let her return to the Underworld. </p>
