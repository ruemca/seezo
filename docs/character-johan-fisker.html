                <h1><span class="bookletter">j</span>ohan Fisker</h1>
                <h2 class="subheading">Early Life</h2>
                <div class="subcontent">
                    <p>Johan is the son of Ulrikke and S&oslash;ren Fisker, born in a small fishing village in southern Denmark. Ulrikke had a series of miscarriages before Johan, and she died in childbirth with him. S&oslash;ren was a good father, but when Johan was about 6 years old, a sudden storm came in from the sea and several fishing boats were lost, including S&oslash;ren's. Johan went to live with his mother's family in a neighboring village, with no belongings except for his father's fiddle and bow. </p> 
                    <p>Johan was withdrawn and depressed after his father's death, and his uncle and aunt struggled to support him emotionally and financially. When he was 10, they took him along to the great market in Hamburg, hoping to find a tradesman to take him on as a helper or a young apprentice. Instead, while he was wandering through the stalls, he found the Seezo crew set up with <a href="character-vera-trumbauer.html" title="Vera Trumbauer (character)">Vera</a>, selling some of their crops. He was attracted to the sound of <a href="character-danny-macfarlain.html" title="Danny MacFarlain (character)">Danny</a> playing his whistle. At first, they didn't understand why he asked to apprentice with them, but <a href="character-min-theopolis.html" title="Min Theopolis (character)">Min</a> and Danny went to speak with Johan's family, and eventually agreed to take him on. </p>
                </div>
                <h2 class="subheading">Seezo</h2>
                <div class="subcontent">
                    <p>When Johan arrived, the older generation had only been on Seezo for a little over two years. They were still struggling to establish their relationships and get the farm going, and he fit in with them quickly. They helped him process his grief, and encouraged his interest in things that reminded him of his father, like fishing and music. He knew how to play his father's fiddle a tiny bit, but Danny especially helped him improve and practice. They traded the Irish and Danish tunes that they remember, and later started playing more with <a href="character-simon-elliot.html" title="Simon Elliot (character)">Simon</a> and <a href="character-miriam-schafer.html" title="Miriam Sch&auml;fer (character)">Miriam</a>. </p>
                    <p>As Johan came out of his shell, he became more of the joker and trickster he had been as a child. He loves to play practical jokes and make other people laugh, especially Simon and Olya. He's usually a loud and boisetrous presence, although he has days when he's more serious and quiet. </p>
                    <p>Johan still considers fishing an important part of his identity, and will take any excuse to go out for several hours on the lake with his pole. He also spends lots of time helping with the farm and the other kids. When Simon arrived, Johan especially took him under his wing, and they became fast friends. When Simon gets overwhelmed by all the noises and smells around the farm, they'll often go out on the water with the pretense of catching fish, because it's so quiet and the rocking boat helps Simon relax. </p>
                    <p>It didn't take long for Johan to develop a huge crush on <a href="character-olya-huber.html" title="Olya HÃ¼ber (character)">Olya</a>, the next oldest in age to him. She teased him at first, but as he grew up she began to take him more seriously. They both had chaotic energy in very different ways, which seemed to balance out when the were together. However, Johan would make an absolute fool of himself if he knew she was watching, just to make her laugh. </p> <!-- #bi4bi couple -->

                <h2 class="subheading">After Seezo</h2>
                <div class="subcontent">
                    <p>After 10 years or so, when both Johan and Olya are in their 20s, they finally get married. At first, they build a small hut near the Seezo Haus just for the two of them, but after a while they get restless. They travel for a little while in France, and then come back to start their own farm near Hafen. Olya has her horses and Johan has his fishing. Pretty soon, they also have their babies. They don't live too far away from Lacht Haus, which eventually becomes the hub of the extended family once everyone else moves away from Seezo. </p>
