                <h1><span class="bookletter">s</span>usanna Koppel</h1>
                <p>Short and slight, curly reddish-blonde hair (still growing out as it was originally cropped), light
                    blue
                    eyes, maimed right arm, intense fear of strangers. Picked on often even before she was crippled,
                    likely
                    born prematurely or simply malnourished. Likes to make daisy crowns. </p>
                <p>Born in an Estonian orphanage to a 15-year-old girl named Maarika, who was a resident. Susanna was
                    raised there, but was sent to work in a factory at age 3. 7 months later, she was sent to Germany
                    to
                    work in a different factory. At age four, her right arm was caught in a machine and was permanently
                    injured, so she was unable to perform her job. She was sent out into the streets, where Vera found
                    her,
                    starving and frostbitten. She is extremely shy both from her personality type and because of her
                    early
                    childhood experiences. </p>
                <p>Vera thought she was mute when she encountered her because she refused to talk at all. The only
                    reason
                    she knows her history was because of an orphanage record copy kept in her jumper pocket at all
                    times,
                    which the orphanage trained her to hand to administrators. When Vera asked who she was, she handed
                    her
                    this paper. She always wears her stripped jumper and insists on keeping a ragged blue shawl that
                    likely
                    belonged to Maarika. Vera is trying to copy the jumper pattern since Susanna is quickly outgrowing
                    her
                    original one. </p>
                <p>She was traumatized by her early childhood experiences in the orphanage and factories, leading to
                    some
                    kind of PTSD or anxiety. She gets easily frightened by loud noises and nervous around large
                    animals,
                    from the machines she worked with before. She largely lived in industrial and urban indoor areas,
                    so
                    she was fascinated by all the colors and smells and lack of business that came with Vera's farm.
                </p>
                <p>She celebrates her name day August 11, per Estonian culture. Vera makes sweet cakes on her birthday
                    because when she first brought her home, Susanna was so thin that she gave her cake right away. </p>
