                <h1><span class="bookletter">s</span>onia</h1>
                <p>Medium-length curly dark hair in a red hair ribbon, medium complexion, and brown eyes. She has a
                    small,
                    subtle smile that she pulls out when she's teasing or thinking of how to trick you. </p>
                <p>Born somewhere in the southern Alps, likely Italy, with a large birthmark on the small of her back
                    that
                    was a sign of bad luck and witchcraft in her parents' village. They were going to drown her shortly
                    after her birth, but a recent mother on a northbound caravan pitied the baby and convinced the
                    mother
                    to let her live. However, she was such a fussy baby in the end that the woman decided not to keep
                    her,
                    and gave her to Vera before they crossed the Dutch border. </p>
                <p>She's sweetest when she's with Susanna, and only pushes her buttons when she's in a good mood, but
                    everyone else knows to watch out for her. She doesn't do anything really harmful, mostly poking and
                    tickling, stealing things, or just laughing hysterically at random times. She likes to chase and
                    roughhouse, and shrieks when she's having fun. She's usually obedient to Vera, but can still
                    sometimes
                    get in trouble for her mischief. Especially if someone pushes her own buttons when she's in a bad
                    mood,
                    she can lash out more than usual. </p>
                <p>She wants to travel the world when she grows up, and loves going to the city and seeing all the
                    sights
                    and smells and sounds. She likes to go to Hamburg on her birthday and eat in a shop and look in all
                    the
                    windows. </p>
