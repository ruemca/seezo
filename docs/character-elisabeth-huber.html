                <h2 class="subheading">Early Life and Childhood</h2>
                <div class="subcontent">
                    <p>Elisabeth is the oldest child of the H&uuml;bers, a wealthy German family with an estate just outside of Hamburg. She and her sister <a href="character-olya-huber.html" title="Olya Hüber (character)">Olya</a>, three years her junior, were raised together by nurses and governesses. Elisabeth was always the model sister of the pair: patient, attentive, eloquent, and "lady-like"; a devout Christian; and conventionally very beautiful. Olya was none of these things, and a jealous younger sibling. As the oldest, she felt an immense pressure to conform to the ideals that her teachers and parents set, but she was a happy child nonetheless. She always had gorgeous handwriting and embroidery skills, and loved to learn dances that were popular at parties. Her youngest sister, <a href="character-sofia-huber.html" title="Sofia Hüber (character)">Sofia</a>, was born when she was ten. </p>
                    <p><a href="character-min-theopolis.html" title="Min Theopolis (character)">Min</a> came to work for the H&uuml;bers when both she and Elisabeth were 12. Initially, they didn't interact much because Elisabeth considered her to be a servant. However, as Min and Sofia spent more time together with the sisters, they became gradually closer. They confided in each other, and Min eventually explained her history to Elisabeth. When Sofia died, Elisabeth blamed Min for failing to use her power to save her youngest sister. When Min disappeared, she felt both guilty and betrayed. </p>
                    <p>Elisabeth struggled to reconcile her faith in the Christian God with her trust in Min's story of the Greek gods. Her family fell apart after the losses, and Elisabeth intended to go away to a convent. When Min returned after almost a year, and recalled Sofia from the underworld, Elisabeth was shaken. Olya was the one who convinced her to go with them to Seezo, and to become immortal. She felt guilty about lying to her parents, but grateful to leave home and have a second chance with her sisters. </p>

                <h2 class="subheading">Seezo</h2>
                <div class="subcontent">
                    <p>She's very particular about her appearance, although some of her vanity has faded as she's lived in the rougher environment of Seezo. She always wears a wide-brimmed straw hat under the sun, and tries to get her sisters to do the same. She also wears her grandmother's wedding ring on a chain around her neck at all times. </p>
                    <p>On Seezo, Elisabeth primarily prefers to work indoors, especially with sewing and mending and teaching the younger children to read. When they rest, she likes to read aloud from books of poetry and stories she kept from her childhood. She's slowly becoming a better cook, but she feels like she doesn't have a talent for it since she never used a stove until she left home. She has the complex of someone who expects to be good at everything, and if she doesn't prove talented right away she's ashamed&mdash;but the others are patient with her. She gets along well with everyone, especially <a href="character-heredes.html" title="Heredes (character)">Heredes</a> and <a href="character-lana-mcfarland.html" title="Lana McFarland (character)">Lana</a>. She and <a href="character-maja-csonkava.html" title="Maja Csonkava (character)">Maja</a> are also good friends, but Maja has complex feelings around the privilege that Elisabeth still holds onto from her childhood. They are the studious ones, and like to read together. </p>
                    <p>One thing she's become much better at is being a good sister. She and Olya have grown especially close since leaving home, because there's less competition between them. Elisabeth has found things she struggles with, and Olya has found things she's passionate about. They are each other's favorite dance partners, and like to ride the horses around the island together as well. She has a more unusual relationship with Sofia, but they are also close and sweet together. </p>
