                <h1><span class="bookletter">a</span>nika Knudsen</h1>
                <p>Long red hair down her back, usually in braids or pigtails, tall for her age, green eyes, small
                    nose, red and black dirndl</p>
                <p>She was born somewhere in Denmark to Thomas and Mathilde Knudsen. Her mother died in childbirth, and
                    her ancient senile grandfather, Yngve, adopted her at age two when her father died of influenza.
                    When Yngve passed away she was taken in by Min. Later, she took a liking to Vera when she visited
                    them and moved into the foster home. </p>
                <p>Her grandfather was an coal miner and taught her traditional songs- her old boots are caked in soot
                    and coal dust from around his house. She misses her grandfather much more than her parents, since
                    she
                    was too young to remember them. </p>
                <p>Her grandfather told her stories every night before bed and taught her to read at an early age. She
                    still has books of fairy tales and illustrations he gave her for her earlier birthdays. She reads
                    and tells stories for the other girls before bed, just like her grandfather did for her. She also
                    teaches them to read and write, as Vera is not a strong reader. </p>
                <p>She loves to play in the snow. Her favorite season is winter because there is so little to do except
                    sit by the fire reading and singing and telling stories. </p>
                <p>She lived with Min for a few months on Seezo, but she liked Vera so much that she decided to move to
                    her farm. As the oldest child in Vera's house, she helps out with many chores, especially in taking
                    care of the younger kids like Hennie and Drika. She also helps out with cooking, since the other
                    girls are too young to use knives or fire by themselves. </p>
