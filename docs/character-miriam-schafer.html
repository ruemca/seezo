                <h1><span class="bookletter">m</span>iriam Sch&auml;fer</h1>
                <p>Curly dark brown hair, blue eyes, muscular, blue and red dirndl with a shawl from Johanna; intense
                    and
                    introspective</p>
                <p>Born in Germany and raised by foster mother named Johanna Sch&auml;fer, who was a jewish weaver and
                    shepherd from the Jutland Peninsula. Johanna died in a fistfight at a pub in a nearby village while
                    Miriam, who was 5, was watching the sheep. When the authorities came to take her back to the
                    orphanage,
                    she hid from them (with Johanna's mule, Elijah) and was later found on the run by a farmer and his
                    wife, who knew Min and convinced Miriam to trust her. </p>
                <p>She doesn't always say what's on her mind, but if she has something to say she's never shy about it
                    and
                    can come across as harsh or blunt. Around her closest friends (Joceline, Sabah, and Sofia) she is
                    much
                    more open and outgoing. She used to be quite short, but had a big growth spurt; however, her
                    personality always makes her seem bigger than she really is. </p>
                <p>She learned a lot of her blunt behavior from Johanna, who was neglectful, often drunk, and abusive
                    at
                    times. She was very curious about where she came from before Johanna, but she ended up with a
                    beating
                    more often than a straight answer. Miriam still respected her authority, but she's been bitter ever
                    since finding a more sympathetic mother in Min. She still keeps an enormous wool shawl that Johanna
                    wove for her- blue and red with white patterns. </p>
                <p>Johanna tasked her to go out and watch the sheep during the day, which she enjoyed greatly for the
                    solitude. She also grew very fond of the mule Elijah, who always hee-hawed and wanted to graze with
                    the
                    flock- he was only allowed out to work since he was so stubborn around hard-fisted Johanna, so
                    Miriam
                    stole him in the end. One year for her adoption day, Henry carved a flock of sheep, like in the
                    nativity scene. </p>
                <p>She's not one for sitting still and reading; she can sew and knit, but much prefers to do so
                    standing
                    up. </p>
                <p>She likes to sing the old German and Jewish songs that Johanna taught her- she and Sabah will sit
                    outside with the sheep singing for ages if they can get away with it. She also has a harmonica that
                    Johanna taught her to play. </p>
                <p>She doesn't consider herself Jewish, but she follows many Jewish practices because that's how
                    Johanna
                    raised her. </p>
