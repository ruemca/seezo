                <h1><span class="bookletter">c</span>harlotte de Castille</h1>
                <p>Brown hair in blue hair ribbons, blue eyes, sachet of dried lavender from mother</p>
                <p>Born in an aristocratic family in Strasbourg to a father, Guillaume, with a drinking and gambling
                    habit
                    and a mother, Oph&#233;lie, with a countless string of lovers. Oph&eacute;lie finally eloped one
                    summer
                    when Charlotte was 6 as the family vacationed in Provence. Her father heard of Min through a friend
                    of
                    a friend in the Netherlands, and he sent his daughter there when he was put in debtor's prison. He
                    wanted her to attend a ladies' finishing school in Frankfurt, which she did for two years while
                    under
                    Min's care until she convinced Min to pull her out. </p>
                <p>Started at school a year early because Guillaume got special permission given his circumstances, but
                    Charlotte wasn't kept informed, so she wasn't really aware that her dad was leaving until they
                    actually
                    met with Min and Vera. </p>
                <p>Oph&eacute;lie used lavender perfume and made sachets of dried lavender for Charlotte during their
                    summers in Provence, before she was old enough to use the scents. She still keeps them with her
                    clothes
                    so that she can smell like her mother and remember her every time she opens her trunk. </p>
                <p>Well-educated by private tutors in German, music, dance, and drawing. Especially loves to sketch and
                    paint with watercolors, and is very fond of painting the view sitting in front of the house on
                    Seezo
                    looking out onto the lake. </p>
                <p>Never had children of her own age to play with growing up, so it was a shock to the system arriving
                    at
                    school in Germany and everyone making friends right away. She felt lonely and acted out a lot, and
                    didn't apply herself during lessons. </p>
                <p>Since arriving at Seezo, she has become a prolific seamstress and embroiderer, and likes to sew new
                    dresses for her rag doll out of old scraps. </p>
                <p>For her first birthday on Seezo, she got a rag doll, and has also gotten hair ribbons and fabric.
