                <h1><span class="bookletter">j</span>oceline Poirier</h1>
                <p>Short, straight almost-black hair with bangs, deep-set brown eyes, pale skin, square face with
                    slight
                    features. Wears a yellow and orange flowered headband.
                    <p>She lived in a slum on the outskirts of Paris until the Black Plague took her mother and
                        brother,
                        Olivier. Her mother wrote to her uncle Antoine when she first became ill, asking him to come
                        and be
                        the godfather. He took over Joceline's care of her mother and brother and wouldn't let her near
                        them. When Olivier died, Antoine wrapped him up and sent away the body before she could see and
                        she
                        ran screaming after the carriage, but he caught her in his arms and she just beat on him. After
                        that, they went to live at his home in Belgium. When he began to sexually abuse her, she ran
                        away
                        and wandered along the coast in Holland and Germany looking for people who spoke French. She
                        befriended Charlotte immediately when she arrived at Seezo so they could speak French together.
                    </p>
                    <p>She cleans herself obsessively, because when she took care of her sick family she was always
                        afraid
                        of catching the plague. She keeps everything very neat and tidy, and always cleans area around
                        her
                        bed in the morning. She prefers to do domestic chores with Lana and Eliza rather than work
                        outside
                        in the garden. </p>
                    <p>She loves cats and grooms all the barn cats, but scolds them when they bring her dead birds. </p>
                    <p>She sings traditional French songs and leads everyone in old Carols at Christmas time because
                        it's
                        her birthday. Charlotte instructed Eliza on how to make Busch de No&euml;l for Joceline's
                        birthday
                        cake as well. </p>
