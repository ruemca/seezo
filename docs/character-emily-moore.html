                <h1><span class="bookletter">e</span>mily Moore</h1>
                <p>She has chin-length stringy, straw-yellow hair with bangs, usually tied in a pony tail or half-up,
                    framing keen green eyes. She likes wearing flowery, calico prints. </p>
                <p>Born in a slum south of London to a Ernest and Rebecca Moore. Emily's brother, Lawrence, left to
                    apprentice with a smith when he was about 10 years old, and accompanied him to Germany some time
                    later.
                    When Emily was 4 or 5, her parents sent her to live with Lawrence, but didn't tell her why. When
                    she
                    arrived at the address in Hamburg, however, there was no smith, and no Lawrence. An old woman
                    helped
                    her find the local blacksmith, where Rainer worked, who in turn sent her to Vera and Min. She never
                    found her brother. </p>
                <p>She's sweet and obedient, but still outgoing in a childlike way of asking more questions than the
                    grown-ups feel comfortable with- she isn't afraid of honesty, but also usually understands when to
                    keep
                    quiet. </p>
                <p>She reveres Eliza because she's the &ldquo;older girl&rdquo; who's also English. She always asks
                    Eliza
                    to make British pudding for her birthday because she remembers them from England. She lives with
                    Vera
                    because she's friends with Sonia and Susanna (otherwise she'd live nearer to Eliza). </p>
                <p>Blue is her favorite color, and she wears it nearly every day (especially in her hair ribbons). When
                    Susanna makes daisy crowns, she always adds forget-me-nots. She's best at bringing out Susanna and
                    getting her to laugh and talk and play. </p>
                <p>Secretly, she still hopes that Lawrence will come back and find her someday, but she's haunted by
                    the
                    possibilities of what might have happened to him. </p>
                <p>She loves to play with the paper dolls Vera made for her for her birthday, but desperately wants a
                    real
                    rag doll. She's very good about sharing her dolls with everyone, and not playing with them during
                    work
                    time. </p>
                <p>She likes to watch the fire burn and often sleeps near the fireplace in the colder months. Vera lets
                    her
                    help light the fire, but she's not allowed to tend it on her own just yet. </p>
