# seezo

This is a personal project that I've been making iterations of for many, many years about a group of my original characters and the story around them. The central character is Minaria (Mina or just Min), a young Greek goddess who is rejected by the gods on Mount Olympus and makes her own way in the world of mortals. You can begin the story on any character's page, and click through links like a Wiki. I recommend starting with <a href="https://ruemca.github.io/seezo/character-min-theopolis.html">Mina's page</a>.
